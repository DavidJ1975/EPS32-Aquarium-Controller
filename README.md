# EPS32-Aquarium-Controller
Work in progress as I learn. Posting here to keep everything in one place, and so that if others see this, maybe I can get advice or links to resources needed in learning to do this project. 

Wanted an aquarium controller that would show water temp on a small OLED screen, but would be accessable via browser to adjust the time the lights came on/off, when the heater (via solid state relay) would activate, and in the even the solidstate broke in the on position, a secondary mechanical would disconnect the heater till someone fixed it (NOT cooking the fish as I've had happen)
Ultimatly I would like to have the ESP32 get time via the internet, and have the HTML page I wrote be the "home" page for the settings.

Again, first attemt at writing much more than "relay on at temp, off at temp" kinda simple stuff, so any input or links to items you feel can help me learn to get this done would be greatly appreciated. 

Figured the first step for me was to get the home page done and branch out from there....
